The negative control for this experiment is S-medium. To analyze this experiment and learn wheter there is an effect of different concentrations on offspring count and wheter the different compounds have a different IC50 curve: First, the mean of the different concentrations are calculated, per compound. Then, these means are divided by the controlNegative mean to calculate the relative effect per compound per concentration. When these relative values are plotted in a curve, the difference in IC50 (if any) will be shown. Finally, there may be run some statistical tests to indicate whether there is a statistically significant difference between different curves. controlNegative &lt;- CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 %&gt;% filter(expType == &quot;controlNegative&quot;) cn_mean &lt;- mean(controlNegative$RawData) cn_mean / cn_mean ## [1] 1 means &lt;- CE.LIQ.FLOW.062 %&gt;% group_by(compName, compConcentration) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(RawData, na.rm = TRUE)) means$relative &lt;- means$mean / cn_mean means %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = log10(compConcentration), y = relative, colour = compName), position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1), size = 2) + labs(title = &quot;Scatterplot from C. elegans experiment&quot;, subtitle = &quot;The raw data against the compound concentration&quot;, x = &quot;Compound concentration&quot;, y = &quot;Raw data&quot;) + theme_minimal() By viewing the data relatively, it visualizes the differences and similarities between data points more accurately than when viewing them as raw data points.
