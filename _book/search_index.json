[["my-python-journey.html", "10 My Python journey", " 10 My Python journey In a little more than two years from now, Id like to be graduating the Applied Data Science master at University Utrecht. This minor is a great prerequisite, as it focuses on R and statistics. Besides that, however, the master also requires basic knowledge of data-analysis and statistics in Python. While the data-analysis and statistics knowledge overall will be the same, Ill need to know how to do these things using Python. Therefore, I will spend this courses free time studying Python, with a focus on data-analysis and statistics. I will start by doing some tutorials on the BeginnersGuide. Then, I will do at least this tutorial on data-analysis using Python. Maybe more, depending on the time it takes. After that, I will walk through this tutorial to get some insight in how to use statistics in Python. This tutorial also incorporates some data wrangling, so it will be a nice addition. While I realize that this obviously isnt enough to learn Python, I think itll make for a great start. Ill try and learn some more over the summer, probably asking some tutoring from my friends that already have a lot of experience using Python (they better be glad, seeing as how theyre always bugging me to start learning it).
