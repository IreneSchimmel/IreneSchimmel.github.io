# Applying the Guerrilla analytics framework

When showing my knowledge of the Guerrilla analytics framework, I wanted to take a project folder that would really transform. I found such a folder in my practice project directory.

As you can see below, it's rather messy. While the folder names are quite clear, the contents are not so much; there are some empty folders, some duplicates and even a folder with another project.

```{r libs}
library(knitr)
```

```{r dir_tree_pre}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "dir_tree_pre.jpg"))
```

Rather overdue for a clean-up!

After removing all unneccesary folders and files from the project directory and storing all the desired files in the right folders, the directory looks like this!

```{r dir_tree_post}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "dir_tree_post.jpg"))
```
